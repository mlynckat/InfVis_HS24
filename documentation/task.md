The module task comprises the completion of a visualization project on a selected topic (detailed information in class). It runs in parallel to most of the semester. You can complete the module task either on your own or in a team of maximal two students. Select a topic and find relevant data. If possible, select data and topic in an area that you are interested in and where there is data available to you. You are free to use any data, software, and tools available to you. Please make sure that the data is not confidential and that you are allowed to complete, submit, and discuss (in class) the project based on it.

## Part 1:

After selecting the topic and finding the data, write a short abstract (max 300 words) describing the data, the project goals and what methods and software you intend to use to complete the project. Send the abstract together with your name(s) and a suitable title in PDF format to susanne.bleisch@fhnw.ch.

## Part 2:

Complete the visualization project by using a range of exploratory visualizations as well as suitable communication graphics. We will discuss many visualization options in class. At the end, you illustrate the process (exploratory visualizations) and the results (communication visualizations or infographics) in the form of a poster (1 page, A3). At least include a title, a short abstract, two or more well-designed communication visualizations (infographics) and accompanying texts describing the goals and questions, data, methods, the process of achieving the results, as well as the results. Add a short paragraph personally reflecting on your learning and the process of completing the module task. Optionally, add one or more of your exploratory visualizations to the poster. The amount of text on your poster should be well balanced with the visualizations (at least 300 words and no more than 800 words). Make sure the poster contains your name(s) and references to external materials (for example sources of data or code as well as literature) correctly and completely. Note that your poster is supposed to document your module task process as much as the actual topic you present. Finally, submit your poster in PDF format on Moodle.

## Part 3:

Your submission will be assessed according to the criteria laid out above in "Part 2" as well as the concepts and theory regarding information visualization taught in the module. You will get short feedback including "accepted" or "rejected". An accepted poster as a result of the completed module task, in accordance with the instructions on this page as well as in class, is required for you to be allowed to attend the final module exams. In case your work is not accepted in the first instance, you can resubmit the improved work once.

## Remark:

You may use the third lecture each week for working on your module task. However, make sure that you either complete the weekly tasks with your module task data or otherwise ensure that you have an opportunity to deepen your understanding of the visualization concepts and theories presented each week through exercises. Completing some of the exercises related to each week's concepts and theories has shown to be a necessity for passing the final exam.
